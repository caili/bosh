Bosh
=========

The @bosh@ library handles creating and pre-authenticating BOSH streams inside your Ruby application before passing them off to your template engine. 

This method allows you to hide authentication details for your users' XMPP accounts.

XMPP via BOSH: http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html
I took bit and pieces from Pradeep's RubyBosh: http://github.com/skyfallsin/ruby_bosh and rewrote most of the lib using Nokogiri.

Example
=======
In your Ruby app controller (or equivalent):

@connection = Bosh.connect("me@server.tld", "donttell", "http://localhost:5280/http-bind")

You can also send messages on the line directly by doing @@connection.send(document)@ where document is @Nokogiri::XML::Document@

In your template, you would then pass these directly to your javascript BOSH connector:

var bosh_jid = '<%= @connection.jid %>';
var bosh_sid = '<%= @connection.sid %>';
var bosh_rid = '<%= @connection.rid %>';

// using Strophe:
connect.attach(bosh_jid, bosh_sid, bosh_rid, onConnectHandlerFunction);
